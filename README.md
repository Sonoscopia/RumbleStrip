#RUMBLE STRIP

The sonic and musical content of this installation is grounded in the use of idiosyncratic loudspeakers,  exploring their particular sound diffusion and the resulting reflections created by the interaction between different sounding objects, such as resonant metal plates and directional loudspeakers pointed at a moving parabolic reflector. The resulting generative composition thus explores the relations between sounding objects and the acoustic space, providing an acoustic image or footprint of a given physical space, leading the listener(s) to explore this space using their listening apparatus.
